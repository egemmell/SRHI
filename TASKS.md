## Breakdown for typical project tasks

### Planning

**1. Organization:** structuring the research project; research workflow  
- [ ] define project goals, objectives, and research questions
- [ ] develop project timeline with milestones and deadlines
- [ ] create task lists or workflows (e.g., Teams, GitHub)
- [ ] set up shared folder structures (cloud storage, version control)
- [ ] establish data management plan (file naming conventions, backups, permissions)
- [ ] assign roles/responsibilities if working with collaborators
- [ ] draft research protocol or study design document
- [ ] identify required software, tools, and computational resources
- [ ] allocate time for writing, analysis, and dissemination phases

**2. Admin:** procedural, compliance, and logistical requirements that support the research; ensures compliance, reporting, and communication obligations are met 
- [ ] submit ethics/IRB applications and amendments
- [ ] prepare and track grant or funding applications
- [ ] schedule and document team meetings
- [ ] manage correspondence with collaborators, and project partners
- [ ] track project expenses and prepare financial reports if needed
- [ ] ensure licenses/software access are up to date
- [ ] archive or deposit data/code in repositories according to funder or journal requirements


### Data

**1. Processing/cleaning:** prepare and process raw data for analysis by handling errors, inconsistencies, and missing values. Ensure datasets are structured and ready for reproducible analysis.
- [ ] access raw data from source(s)
- [ ] explore structure (variable types, missing values)
- [ ] handle missing values (imputation, removal, or flagging)
- [ ] standardize variable names and coding (units, categorical levels)
- [ ] merge or join datasets (if multiple sources)
- [ ] create a clean, reproducible version of dataset

**2. Descriptive analysis:** summarize and explore the data to identify patterns, distributions, and potential anomalies. Provides foundation for further inferential work.
- [ ] calculate summary statistics (mean, median, SD, percentiles etc.)
- [ ] generate frequency tables and cross-tabulations
- [ ] explore distributions of key variables (histograms, density plots)
- [ ] identify and document outliers
- [ ] produce initial descriptive report (tables + plots)

**3. Inferential analysis:** apply statistical methods to test hypotheses, estimate relationships, and assess significance
- [ ] define hypotheses / research questions
- [ ] choose appropriate statistical models (e.g., regression, mixed-effects)
- [ ] check assumptions (normality, independence, variance)
- [ ] fit models and extract coefficients / estimates
- [ ] conduct sensitivity or robustness checks
- [ ] document results and interpret in context

**4. Visualizations:** create clear, interpretable visual publication quality representations of results for exploration and communication
- [ ] draft exploratory plots during analysis (scatter, boxplots, timeseries)
- [ ] refine plots for clarity (labels, legends, colors, accessibility)
- [ ] produce publication-quality figures (ggplot, matplotlib, etc.)
- [ ] align visualization outputs with manuscript or report requirements
- [ ] export figures in multiple formats (PNG, PDF, SVG)

**5. Refactoring/finalizing code:** clean up, document, and optimize analysis scripts for reproducibility, transparency, and reuse
- [ ] remove redundant or unused code
- [ ] modularize scripts (functions, pipelines)
- [ ] add comments and docstrings
- [ ] apply consistent coding style (formatting)
- [ ] save final scripts in organized repo structure
- [ ] write README or workflow documentation.
      
### Writing

**1. Drafting:** generate the first version of the text by translating ideas, data, and arguments into written form
- [ ] outline structure (sections, key points, flow)
- [ ] write full sentences/paragraphs for each section
- [ ] incorporate figures, tables, and references in placeholder form
- [ ] note areas where more information, citations, or analysis are needed
- [ ] save working draft in version control

**2. Revisions:** revise and strengthen the draft through multiple versions, improving clarity, organization, and readability; incorporate feedback from collaborators
- [ ] review flow of ideas and reorganize sections if needed
- [ ] improve clarity and precision of language
- [ ] add or refine citations, update references
- [ ] integrate feedback from collaborators
- [ ] ensure consistency in terminology, style, and formatting
- [ ] update figures and tables with final or cleaned versions

**3. Finalizing:** prepare the manuscript for submission by revising formatting, ensuring compliance with guidelines
- [ ] proofread for grammar, spelling, and punctuation
- [ ] ensure formatting matches journal or report requirements
- [ ] verify citations are complete and correctly styled
- [ ] check figures and tables meet resolution and formatting standards
- [ ] confirm acknowledgments, author list, and contributions
- [ ] export and save final version
- [ ] Submit or circulate finalized document

### Collaboration

**1. Outreach:** initiating contact with potential collaborators, stakeholders, or community partners
- [ ] identify relevant researchers, organizations, or community groups aligned with project goals
- [ ] prepare concise project overview (one-pager, slide deck, or abstract)
- [ ] draft and send introductory emails or messages (including project overview materials)
- [ ] propose initial meeting times and formats (Zoom, coffee chat, workshop)
- [ ] publicize opportunities for collaboration (calls for participants, research posters, presentations)

**2. Networking:** building and maintaining professional relationships to support ongoing research
- [ ] attend academic conferences, seminars, or workshops
- [ ] participate in professional associations, working groups, or advisory boards
- [ ] share project updates or preliminary findings on professional platforms (e.g., LinkedIn, ResearchGate, mailing lists)
- [ ] set up informal check-ins with collaborators, stakeholders, community partners

**3. Follow-up:** sustaining engagement and fostering ongoing collaboration
- [ ] send thank-you notes after meetings or presentations
- [ ] share relevant resources, notes, or next steps promptly after discussions
- [ ] add collaborators to shared platforms
- [ ] track action items agreed upon in meetings and check on progress
- [ ] provide periodic updates (project milestones, new data, publications)
- [ ] acknowledge contributions and invite feedback on drafts or outputs
- [ ] schedule regular check-ins to sustain collaboration
