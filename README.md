# BREATHE Health Data
## About this Repository

This private repository contains the code and directory structure for cleaning, preparation and analysis of health data for the BREATHE project.
It includes files and directories recommended for enabling reproducibility and collaboration on the project. Although the data folders are included, datasets themselves will be shared securely with team members as not all are open source.
