# BREATHE Health Outcomes 
## About this Repository
This private repository contains the code and directory structure for cleaning, preparation and descriptive analysis of health data for the BREATHE project.
Baseline demographic and health outcome data was obtained from government and research databases. Demographic variables, including age, race/ethnicity, population density and neighbourhood deprivation were used to describe the characteristics of the study area. 


## Repo Structure
This repository contains files and directories recommended for enabling reproducibility and collaboration. Data will be shared securely with team members as not all data is open source.
