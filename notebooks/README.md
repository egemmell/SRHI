## About README

On an online repository, such as GitHub, the project overview page is named ‘README’ which is equivalent to the main page of a website.
README page should describe the project -- what is the purpose of the project, who is involved, how to collaborate and where to find key resources.

To learn more about how to create a README.md file, please read the [Landing Page - README File](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/project-design/project-repo/project-repo-readme.html) chapter in The Turing Way Guide for Project Design.
